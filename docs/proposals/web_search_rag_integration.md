# Feature Request: Web Search Integration with RAG System

**Created:** 2025-08-03  
**Author:** Sarthak Joshi  
**Status:** Proposal  

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive web search integration with the existing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to combine real-time web information with static knowledge bases through intelligent query routing, parallel retrieval, and sophisticated result synthesis.

## Problem Statement

**Current Limitations:**
- RAG system is limited to static knowledge bases, creating knowledge cutoffs
- Missing current information and real-time data
- No intelligent routing between internal documents and web search
- Limited to URL extraction from user messages rather than proactive search

**Impact:**
- Users cannot get up-to-date information on current events
- Responses may contain outdated information
- Reduced system utility for time-sensitive queries

## Proposed Solution

Implement a hybrid retrieval system that intelligently combines internal documents with real-time web search results through advanced synthesis techniques, following the design outlined in `brainstorming/claude/web_search_rag.md`.
